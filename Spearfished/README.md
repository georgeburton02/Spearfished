Overview

Description
- Provides a place for Spear fishers to post good spearfishing spots, and post the kind of fish that are in specific areas.

App Evaluation:


* Category: Social sport app
* Mobile: For now yes but in the future I could develope a computer version
* Story: Provides a space for spearfishers, and normal fishers to comunicate on spot quality
* Market: The spear fishing community
* Habit: It depends on what the person wants if the person spearfishes/fishes everyday it is daily use.
* Scope: It has a medium scope I would say it deals with location, backend, and possibly api for the fish info.
